===Summary===
The point of mcp_rebuild is to allow you to store your code outside of MCP's
dangerous src/ directory by providing you with one simple command to install
all of your mods to MCP, recompile and reobfuscate them, and automatically
package each of your mods into its own versioned zip file.

===Instructions===
To use mcp_rebuild:

1. Create a new MCP directory, with both client and server files.
2. If applicable, install ModLoader and Forge.
3. Run decompile.sh to produce a clean src/ directory for MCP.
4. Obtain mcp_rebuild, and place it into its own directory.  An mcp_rebuild
   directory underneath the MCP directory works well.
5. Configure mcp_rebuild by editing settings.py.  (This is not optional.)
6. Run mcp_rebuild once, by starting rebuild.bat (for Windows users) or
   rebuild.sh (for Linux/Cygwin users).  Tell mcp_rebuild that MCP's source
   directory is clean (since you just made it).
   This causes mcp_rebuild to record a "clean state" that it will reset MCP's
   source directory to before each compilation.
7. Create one or more projects in your USER directory.  The format for a
   project can be found below.
   Note: If you didn't let mcp_rebuild create the directory for you, you need
   to create a CATEGORY file in it (contents are unimportant) so that
   mcp_rebuild does not consider it a single project.
8. Run mcp_rebuild to build your projects.
9. Fix the inevitable errors and return to step 8 until it actually *does*
   work.

WARNING: mcp_rebuild does not detect and package inner classes.  If you use
         inner classes, be sure to add them to the final package manually.


===Project directory format===
When run, mcp_rebuild scans through your USER directory to find projects to
build.  Each project should have the following form, with all pieces optional:

$PROJECT_NAME/
  CATEGORY - If present, this directory is treated as a category which can
             contain projects (or other categories) and not a project itself.
             (Note: You could have a single project by removing this file
              from USER, but I don't recommend it.)
  DISABLED - If present, this project or category will be skipped by
             mcp_rebuild.  Useful for "turning off" projects that won't
             compile right now.
  src/
    client/ - Client-specific source files go here.
    server/ - Server-specific source files go here.
    common/ - Shared source files go here.  Most of your code should be here.
  bin/
    client/ - Pre-compiled files needed by the client during reobfuscation go
              here.  They will not be included in the client package.
    server/ - Pre-compiled files needed by the server during reobfuscation go
              here.  They will not be included in the server package.
    common/ - Pre-compiled files needed by both client and server during
              reobfuscation go here.  They will not be included in either
              package.
  resources/
    client/ - Resources to pack into the client .zip go here.
              (GUI resources belong here.)
    server/ - Resources to pack into the server .zip go here.
    common/ - Resources to pack into both .zips go here.
              (Generic READMEs, LICENSEs, and such should be here.)
  conf/
    PROJECT_NAME    - Overrides the directory's name for the project.
    VERSION         - A version number to include in the package name.
    PACKAGE_NAME    - Overrides the default "Name" or "Name-version"
                      name for the project's package.  The server tag and
                      .zip extension will be applied after this.
    HIDE_SOURCE     - If present, mcp_rebuild will not include the project's
                      source in its package.  Be nice to your fellow modders,
                      don't turn it on unless you need to.
    PACKAGE_COMMAND - An alternative command for building the project's
                      package.  Only a single line is supported, so complex
                      packaging should reference a script here.
