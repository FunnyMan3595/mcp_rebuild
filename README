Settings and documentation for rebuild.py can be found in its source code.
Anything that's not immediately clear to a programmer should be reported as a
bug, either at https://github.com/FunnyMan3595/mcp_rebuild or directly via
email to funnyman3595@gmail.com.

If you're trying to use this and are not a programmer, go ahead and report
that, too, because I'd like to know why.
